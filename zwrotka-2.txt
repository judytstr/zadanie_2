Every step I take I leave a small piece
Of myself behind, soon there will be nothing left
The cracks in the pavement
Match the cracks in their weathered skin
The sky's a brick wall, the ground's a juggernaut
Each day they get a bit closer, between them, I am caught
I stare in amazement
I can't believe this is where I live
Every breath I take I feel my lungs seal
This breeze feels more like shards of glass I'm more scars than skin
