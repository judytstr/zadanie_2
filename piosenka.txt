Our steps seal fate
Our steps seal fate
This is our celebration
Come join the lost souls
This is our celebration
Come join the lost souls
This city, this city is haunted
Oh, walk with us
Oh, down, walk with us
This city, this city is haunted
By ghosts (ghosts) from broken homes (homes)
Because this city, this city is haunted
And there's no hope (hope) left for these souls (souls)
