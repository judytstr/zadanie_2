This town has its claws buried in my neck
This town, it takes lives, without mercy, without hate
The streets are in distress
The sun suffocates behind darkened skies
The grass is growing on top of my feet
I'm sinking, won't be long, before I'm too deep to run
The line up seems endless
Underneath the salvation signs
We are the dead ones, we are the lost cause
We are the bend before the break, our steps seal our fate
Because this city, this city is haunted
By ghosts (ghosts) from broken homes (homes)
Because this city, this city is haunted
And there's no hope (hope) left for these souls (souls)
Every step I take I leave a small piece
Of myself behind, soon there will be nothing left
The cracks in the pavement
Match the cracks in their weathered skin
The sky's a brick wall, the ground's a juggernaut
Each day they get a bit closer, between them, I am caught
I stare in amazement
I can't believe this is where I live
Every breath I take I feel my lungs seal
This breeze feels more like shards of glass I'm more scars than skin
Because this city, this city is haunted
By ghosts (ghosts) from broken homes (homes)
Because this city, this city is haunted
And there's no hope (hope) left for these souls (souls)
Our steps seal fate
Our steps seal fate
This is our celebration
Come join the lost souls
This is our celebration
Come join the lost souls
This city, this city is haunted
Oh, walk with us
Oh, down, walk with us
This city, this city is haunted
By ghosts (ghosts) from broken homes (homes)
Because this city, this city is haunted
And there's no hope (hope) left for these souls (souls)
