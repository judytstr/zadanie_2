This town has its claws buried in my neck
This town, it takes lives, without mercy, without hate
The streets are in distress
The sun suffocates behind darkened skies
The grass is growing on top of my feet
I'm sinking, won't be long, before I'm too deep to run
The line up seems endless
Underneath the salvation signs
We are the dead ones, we are the lost cause
We are the bend before the break, our steps seal our fate
